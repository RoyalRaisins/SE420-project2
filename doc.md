To deploy the continuous integration platform, first download the jenkins for windows installer, and run it. After the installation complete, the jenkins server will be run on localhost:8080 if it is not taken. Because we use a github repo, we choose to install the github plugin.
To Activate it, first enter some code generated by Jenkins, and then sign up as a new member.
To link a github repo to Jenkins, create a job and fill in the git repo address and username and password.
To use webhook to notify Jenkins when push happens, configure settings of repo in github and activate the Github hook trigger option in trigger settings.
